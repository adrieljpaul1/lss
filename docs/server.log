Yeah, an SBC (Single Board Computer) is actually a great choice for your light-weight Node.js + MQTT setup. Given your project, which likely involves handling sensor data, managing MQTT messages, and perhaps a simple web interface, an SBC like the **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W** or **Radxa Rock 4A** should work well.  

### Why an SBC is a Good Choice for Your Project:
1. **Low Power Consumption:**  
   - Perfect for IoT-based systems that need to run continuously without high energy costs.  
2. **Compact Size:**  
   - Easy to integrate into your LSS project setup.  
3. **Sufficient Performance:**  
   - SBCs can easily handle MQTT message brokering and Node.js applications, especially for small to medium-scale projects.  
4. **Built-in Wi-Fi (Pi Zero 2 W):**  
   - Makes it easier to connect with your IoT devices without extra hardware.  
5. **Linux Environment:**  
   - Full-fledged OS support for running Node.js and setting up MQTT brokers like Mosquitto or EMQX.  

### Which SBC to Choose?  
**1. Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W** (Affordable, Compact, Easy Setup)  
- Quad-core Cortex-A53  
- 512MB RAM (might limit multitasking but enough for MQTT + light Node.js)  
- Built-in Wi-Fi & Bluetooth  
- Great community support  

**2. Radxa Rock 4A** (More Power, Future Expansion)  
- Rockchip RK3399 (Dual Cortex-A72 + Quad Cortex-A53)  
- 4GB RAM (better multitasking)  
- Faster I/O (eMMC, USB 3.0, etc.)  
- More suited if you're planning to scale or add heavy processing later.  

### Considerations:
- If your use case is **just handling MQTT and basic Node.js**, the Pi Zero 2 W is a cost-effective, energy-efficient choice.  
- If you foresee **future expansion** with dashboards, data logging, or heavier processing, the Radxa Rock 4A offers better headroom.  

If you're on a budget and want something simple, **go for the Pi Zero 2 W.** If you want flexibility and power, **the Rock 4A is the better choice.**
